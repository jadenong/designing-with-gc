Notes for the "Designing with TI Graphing Calculators" competition

## 2020 Competition
Unfortunately, I didn't participate in the competition this year, since I missed the deadline. This was especially unfortunate considering I'd already (more-or-less) done up a full submission for the competition. Although I wasn't able to compete, I still learned a lot from making my own GC design, and I do hope to participate this year. 

I'd like to share what I've learned too, so this repo contains my notes and code for my (unsubmitted) submission. I hope this helps you!
